# 🗓️ NLP Roadmap (IIT Delhi Syllabus + CS224n Essentials) — 1 Month Plan

## ✅ Week 1: Basics, Word Embeddings & RNNs

### 🎥 Lectures (IIT Delhi)
- [ ] Introduction to NLP
- [ ] Language Modeling, N-grams
- [ ] Word2Vec (CBOW, Skip-Gram)
- [ ] GloVe embeddings
- [ ] Introduction to RNNs, GRU/LSTM

### 📖 CS224n Readings (Essential)
- [ ] Lecture 2: Word Vectors and Matrix Factorization (slides + video)
- [ ] Lecture 4: Backpropagation Through Time

### 💻 Hands-on Tasks
- [ ] Train Word2Vec using `gensim` or `torchtext`
- [ ] Build a basic RNN text classifier (e.g., IMDB or sentiment)
- [ ] Visualize embeddings with PCA or TSNE

## ✅ Week 2: Sequence Models, Attention, Transformers

### 🎥 Lectures (IIT Delhi)
- [ ] Sequence-to-Sequence Models
- [ ] Attention Mechanisms
- [ ] Transformers – Encoder-Decoder Architecture

### 📖 CS224n Readings (Essential)
- [ ] Lecture 7: Attention Mechanism
- [ ] Lecture 8: Transformer and Self-Attention

### 💻 Hands-on Tasks
- [ ] Implement attention from scratch (or use PyTorch built-in)
- [ ] Mini translator using Seq2Seq + attention
- [ ] Try Hugging Face summarization with `BartForConditionalGeneration`

## ✅ Week 3: Contextual Embeddings & BERT

### 🎥 Lectures (IIT Delhi)
- [ ] ELMo, ULMFiT
- [ ] BERT and Transfer Learning
- [ ] RoBERTa, DistilBERT

### 📖 CS224n Readings (Essential)
- [ ] Lecture 9: Contextual Word Embeddings
- [ ] Lecture 10: Pretraining & Fine-Tuning

### 💻 Hands-on Tasks
- [ ] Fine-tune BERT on a text classification task (e.g., news classification)
- [ ] Use `transformers` pipeline for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- [ ] Compare frozen vs fine-tuned performance

## ✅ Week 4: LLMs, Prompting & Final Project

### 🎥 Lectures (IIT Delhi)
- [ ] Prompt Engineering
- [ ] RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)
- [ ] DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)
- [ ] Recent Trends in LLMs
